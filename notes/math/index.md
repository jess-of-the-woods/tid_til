### Floating Point Numbers

Floating point rounding error: `0.1 + 0.2 = 0.300000000000001`

- Significant figures
- scientific notation

### Fibonacci sequence

Each element in the sequence is equal to the sum of the two previous elements: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21...

Related to the Golden Ratio


### Factorials
Factorials are recursively defined functions.

5 Factorial is written as `5!`
start with 5, go down in whole numbers eg. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 and multiply them all together  = 120

or x * (x-1) * (x-2) * (x-3) ... until we reach 1

2! = 2
1! = 1
0! = 1


### Factor
a number or quantity that when multiplied with another produces a given number or expression.
