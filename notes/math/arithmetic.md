## Arithmetic

### Division
**Dividend**: a number to be divided by another number.

**Divisor**: The number you divide by.

**Quotient**: a quotient (Latin: quotiens "how many times") is the result of division.

For example, when dividing 6 by 3, the quotient is 2, while 6 is called the dividend, and 3 the divisor. The quotient is further expressed as the number of times the divisor divides into the dividend, e.g., 3 divides 2 times into 6. A quotient can also refer to the integer part of the result of dividing two integers in Euclidean division. For example, the quotient of 13 divided by 5 would be 2 while the remainder would be 3.

**Operand**: the quantity on which an operation is to be done.

### Power
The power of a number says how many times to use the number in a multiplication. It is written as a small number to the right and above the base number. Also known as index or exponent.
For example: 8 to the power of 2 means 8 Ã— 8 = 64
