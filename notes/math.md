### Research
- Notation for large numbers
- Manifolds

### Binary Notation

you would express the number 64 like this in binary notation:

| 128 | 64 | 32  | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0   | 1 | 0 | 0  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |



The number 255 is the largest number you can represent as an octet, as follows:

| 128 | 64 | 32  | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1   | 1 | 1 | 1  | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

or 8 'on' switches

the number '0' would be 8 off switches

the number 15 would be expressed as follows:

| 128 | 64 | 32  | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0   | 0 | 0 | 0  | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

### Floating Point Numbers

Floating point rounding error: `0.1 + 0.2 = 0.300000000000001`

### Division
**Dividend**: a number to be divided by another number.

**Divisor**: The number you divide by.

**Quotient**: a quotient (Latin: quotiens "how many times") is the result of division.

For example, when dividing 6 by 3, the quotient is 2, while 6 is called the dividend, and 3 the divisor. The quotient is further expressed as the number of times the divisor divides into the dividend, e.g., 3 divides 2 times into 6. A quotient can also refer to the integer part of the result of dividing two integers in Euclidean division. For example, the quotient of 13 divided by 5 would be 2 while the remainder would be 3.

**Operand**: the quantity on which an operation is to be done.

### Power
The power of a number says how many times to use the number in a multiplication. It is written as a small number to the right and above the base number. Also known as index or exponent.
For example: 8 to the power of 2 means 8 Ã— 8 = 64

### Fibonacci sequence

Each element in the sequence is equal to the sum of the two previous elements: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21...

Related to the Golden Ratio


### Factorials
Factorials are recursively defined functions.

5 Factorial is written as `5!`
start with 5, go down in whole numbers eg. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 and multiply them all together  = 120

or x * (x-1) * (x-2) * (x-3) ... until we reach 1

2! = 2
1! = 1
0! = 1


### Factor
a number or quantity that when multiplied with another produces a given number or expression.

### Statistics
